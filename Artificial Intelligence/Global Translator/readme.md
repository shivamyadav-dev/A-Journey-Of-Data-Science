## Problem Statement

In our increasingly interconnected world, language barriers remain a significant challenge. While many translation tools exist, they often only provide text-based output. This is insufficient for language learners who need to hear correct pronunciation or for individuals who prefer auditory learning. Furthermore, finding a simple, all-in-one tool that provides both text translation and high-quality audio playback can be difficult.

## ✨ Features

This application provides a seamless solution by integrating translation and audio generation in one simple interface.

* **Text-to-Text Translation:** Instantly translate text between dozens of languages.
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Generate high-quality audio of the translated text.
* **Audio Playback:** Listen to the audio directly in the web browser.
* **Downloadable Audio:** Download the generated audio as an `.mp3` file to use offline.
* **Simple UI:** A clean, two-column layout built with Streamlit for maximum ease of use.
* **Wide Language Support:** Supports a vast number of languages for both translation and audio generation.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

This project is built using the following open-source libraries:

* **[Python](https://www.python.org/):** The core programming language.
* **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/):** For building and serving the interactive web application.
* **[mtranslate](https://pypi.org/project/mtranslate/):** A simple and free library for using Google Translate's API.
* **[gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/):** A library to interface with Google's Text-to-Speech API, generating an `.mp3` file from text.

## 🌟 Benefits of the App

* **Language Learning:** An excellent tool for students learning a new language. You can check your translation and immediately hear the correct pronunciation.
* **Accessibility:** Provides an audio alternative to text, making information accessible to a wider audience, including those with visual impairments.
* **Travel & Communication:** Quickly translate a phrase and play the audio, helping to bridge communication gaps when traveling.
* **Efficiency:** Acts as an all-in-one tool, removing the need to use one service for translation and another for text-to-speech.
