Salary Predictor using Simple Linear Regression üìà
This is a simple but complete end-to-end machine learning project built as a first step into the world of data science. The goal is to predict a person's salary based on their years of experience.

The project starts with data exploration in a Jupyter Notebook, moves to training a model, and finishes by deploying the model in a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit.

(Optional: You can record a short GIF of your Streamlit app and upload it to your repository to embed it here!)

‚ú® Features
Jupyter Notebook (simple_linear_regression.ipynb): Contains the full data analysis, visualization, and model training process.

Trained Model (linear_regression_model.pkl): The Simple Linear Regression model trained on the dataset and saved using pickle.

Interactive Web App (app.py): A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit that allows anyone to get a salary prediction in real-time.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: For building and training the machine learning model.

Streamlit: To create the interactive web application.

Matplotlib: For data visualization in the notebook.

Pickle: For saving and loading the trained model.
